// As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.
// Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
// Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
// The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
// Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
// Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.





// As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
// Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
